## Project Analysis

### PMD

For project analysis, I employed the [PMD Source Code Analyzer](https://pmd.github.io/).

The analysis results can be explored in detail through the following link: [PMD-Report](/Analysis/Coverage/PMD-Report.html)

### Coverage

I will be firstly using both <span style="background-color:#3498db; color:#fff;">Intelij Building Coverage</span> and <span style="background-color:#e74c3c; color:#fff;">Jacoco</span>
As one can see on the following screenshots, the coverage was terrible, but wasn't at 0, which is already, something.

<summary style="background-color:#3498db; color:#fff;">Intelij Report</summary>

<summary style="background-color:#e74c3c; color:#fff;">Jacoco Report</summary>

#### Jacoco

By putting the 2 reports next to each other, we can directly stop some big difference of result, especially for the **data**
